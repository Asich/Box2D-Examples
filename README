Box2D-Ragdoll-Example
=====================

What is this?
-------------

It's just a port of the Ragdoll example (originally created by Matthew Bush) from the [http://www.box2dflash.org/]Box2DAS3 to Cocos2D for iPhone.
I took the opportunity to add the management of the multi-touch and the accelerometer to allow user to enhance its user experience.

How do I use it?
----------------

You have to download the code and run it under Xcode4.

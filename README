Box2D-Example
=====================

What is this?
-------------

It's just a port of some examples (originally created by Matthew Bush) from the http://www.box2dflash.org/ to Cocos2D for iPhone.
I took the opportunity to add some improvements like the management of the multi-touch and the accelerometer to allow user to enhance its user experience.

How do I use it?
----------------

You have to download the code and run it under Xcode4.

Examples list:
--------------
* Ragdoll
* Buoyancy
